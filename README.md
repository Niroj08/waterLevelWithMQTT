# waterLevelWithMQTT

This project was a demo for the water level analysis using MQTT for android.
I hope the API is down, this will be good for the developers who want to use the following technologies

- MQTT client (paho) to connect to MQTT Broker.
- Retrofit for network connection
- com.daimajia.androidanimations for some UI animations 
- MPAndroidChart and MPAndroidChart-Realm used to show the graph for the water level.

The main concept of the project was to analysis the water level of the tank
and then update the user to his android device from where he can even turn off and on the motor.
